KNOWN ISSUES
============

(1) Ajax is not working on blur in p:edit form fields (had to disable)
    Alert box showing "error malformedXML"

(2) No list of workspaces

(3) @AfterTransactionSuccess observer does not work

(4) Ghost click first time clicking on View after results are returned
    Mojarra Issue #1116; ViewState is not being put in form on partial page update

(5) If you visit the main.seam page before logging in, when you logging, you remain an anonymous user; the session-scoped
    user bean is not being cleared on login. (temporary fix)

(6) blank user shown after registering

TODO
====

- secure pages (likely will use <f:event type="beforeRenderView"/>
- get status messages from default or resource bundle (not just hardcoded defaults)
- demonstrate use of exception handling in JSF 2
- auto-detect which files have @NotNull or @NotEmpty to determine whether to put the * in <p:edit>
- use Cargo plugin to support deployment to other Java EE application servers (GlassFish)
- refactor the password/confirm password into a reusable component (needed on registration and change password)
- consider using unpackTypes in the ear plugin (which works incrementally) to replace portions of the antrun logic
- use a resource to define persistence context:
<EntityManager>
   <PersistenceContext>
      <unitName>booking</unitName>
   </PersistenceContext>
   <booking:BookingDatabase/>
</EntityManager>


OPEN QUESTIONS
==============

- How do I clear a contextual bean from a scope, in particular the session scope? I've had to do workarounds.

- How do I inject an Event object into a stateful component? I get an error that there is a reference to a
  non-serializable object from a bean declaring a non-passivating scope. I have to use the Manager to fire an event
  instead.
